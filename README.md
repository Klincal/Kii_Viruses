# Viruses!
Welcome to the Klinical virus repo, for all things about the wonderful, terrifying, schrodinger (because they're neither
dead nor alive) world of viruses!

## How to navigate the this page:
This is the main page where I will post general information about viruses. The README.md file may get a little long and
for that I apologize. I just wanted a general resource to define some of the terms and strategies that we will be using
in this project.

*Eventually it might get easier I'd like to set up a pages.github site with Jekyll just need to invest the time to learn
how to do so.*

## 1. The "Basics"

## 2. Infection

## 3. Immunity
(This topic will later get its own repo because its so hella complicated - in a fun way I promise)
## 4. Vaccines
(Same with this section, it rightfully deserves its own section.)

There is such a wonderful and brilliant history to vaccines, I look forward to getting to share them with you! There has
been decades of hard work that go into each shot! Wait until we learn about the flu vaccine...
